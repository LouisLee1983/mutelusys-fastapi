# REFUND POLICY

## REFUND AND EXCHANGE

**Our policy lasts 30 days.** We understand how difficult it can be to choose personal items online. Therefore, all orders can be returned/exchanged for a full refund within 30 days, with proof of purchase. Damages caused by regular wear do not qualify for a replacement.

Please note you may return most MUTELU items (unused) in their original packaging. The cost of return shipping is not included. Shipping costs and additional service charges such as gift wrap are non-refundable.

However, we will also pay the return shipping costs if the return is a result of our error (you received an incorrect or defective item, etc.).

You'll receive a refund or replacement once we receive the item back if the item is in stock.

Please note that after an exchange is made, the item(s) do not qualify for refunds.

If 30 days have gone by since your purchase, unfortunately, we can't offer you a refund or exchange.

## Return Eligibility

Free items from special offers are final sale. Please note that returns and exchanges are not available in this case.

To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be in the original packaging.

Return labels will be provided only for defective products within the policy time.

Return shipping costs vary depending on the product weight, your shipping location, and the express delivery you choose.

## Additional Non-Returnable Items

- Gift cards
- Personalized products
- Sage sticks, candles, and soaps after being opened or used
- Sale items (special offers)

## Refunds (if applicable)

Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.

If you are approved, your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within 1 week. All shipping costs of the original order are non-refundable.

If you've done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at **contact@mail.mutelusys.com**

## Late or Missing Refunds (if applicable)

If you haven't received a refund yet, first check your bank account again.

Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.

Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.

If you've done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at **contact@mail.mutelusys.com**

## Sale Items (if applicable)

Only regular priced items may be refunded, unfortunately sale items cannot be refunded.

## Exchanges (if applicable)

We only replace items if they are defective or damaged. If you need to exchange it for the same item, send us an email at **contact@mail.mutelusys.com**.

## Gifts

If the item was marked as a gift when purchased and shipped directly to you, you'll receive a gift credit for the value of your return. Once the returned item is received, a gift certificate will be mailed to you.

If the item wasn't marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the order shipped to themselves to give to you later, we will send a refund to the gift giver and he will find out about your return.

## Returns Without Label

To return your product, you will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund.

Depending on where you live, the time it may take for your exchanged product to reach you, may vary.

You may use your own shipping method. We highly recommend using a shipper who provides a tracking number so you can track your shipment. Please be sure to retain this tracking number for your records. MUTELU is not responsible for packages lost in transit if sent via a non-trackable carrier.
